"Harvey Walters is devoured by the beast. Arkham is overrun by evil. Eventually, the world. RIP Harvey Walters. At least you tried, old man."
Harvey Walters attacks with his dagger like a crazy person. The Cthulhu takes a few stab but quickly heals the majority of the wounds.
The Cthulhu has awoken! Harvey Walters has been more or less useless in the preventing of this terrible event! Portals everywhere. Duh.
Thank goodness that dog got home safe anOHGOD IT'S THE CTHULHU!!!
Harvey successfully grabs it by the collar. His tag says a nearby address. Harvey takes him home and the owner rewards him $3 as thanks.
A cringing dog is seen roaming around nearby! (THE DOG! ITS THE DOG!!)
Harvey Walters wakes up in the woods. Not sure how or when he got here... #ArkhamHorror
The trip is disorienting. Confusing. Where is he going? How long has he been traveling?? He feels... lost... #ArkhamHorror
Nothing. The place is empty. Fine! Harvey will go investigate the open portal where Independence Square used to be.
Harvey ducks into the nearby Newspaper headquarters to see whats up.
"Thanks to his brand new magical dagger, the attacking cultist was quickly turned into a dead one. #ArkhamHorror"
"Leaving the shoppe, Harvey encounters a cultist!"
Harvey surveys the odds and ends on sale. Finds a dagger! Gladius of Carcosa it's called. SOLD! Only $7. Lets hope the bank doesn't mind.
The path to the general store may still be blocked. But the curiosity shoppe down the street is all clear! Harvey will see what they have.
Harvey sees an open portal returning to Arkham and takes it! It closes behind him. But Harvey knows he isn't safe. #ArkhamHorror
"The city of R'lyeh is busy and confusing, swarming with alien beings. Harvey has to move quickly to get out of their way."
The world around him is engulfed in light! Harvey is lifted off his feet and sucked through an opening portal! Landing far away in R'lyeh
A tree branch falls and nearly knocks Harvey into the water. But it doesn't. So everythings fine guys!
"On his way to the general store, Harvey sees a giant beast lurking in the distance. HELL no. Let's check out the unvisited isle instead."
"Harvey still doesn't feel properly armed. He needs a weapon. But first, he needs money. Time for a bank loan."
"Harvey Walters is now the proud owner of ""Summoning Glass"". Thanks buddy. Next time can I please at least shop around a bit?"
"Harvey coughs up the $4, fearing for his safety if he refused. #ArkhamHorror"
A sketchy looking fellow tries to pawn off what appears to be an artifact from the exhibit. His insistence is extremely aggressive.
An traveling Egyptian exhibit is in town that has attracted much interest. Perhaps this is somehow tied in. Harvey investigates the exhibit
"Armed with a couple old artifacts, some spell knowledge, and an iron will, this old man is ready to face the evil ahead!"
Harvey Walters vs The Cthulhu #ArkhamHorror #SoloBoardGame

#GoCarolynFern #Winning #ArkhamHorror #SuckItShub
"Thanks to a very memorable patient and a keen sense of curiosity, Carolyn found herself not only a visitor of Arkham, but it's savior."
The beast's corpse dissolves before her eyes leaving a swampy mess. The streets are quiet once again.
Until the beast is no more. It lies limp on the ground. The creatures roaming the streets flee into their rapidly disappearing portals.
"With energy to spare, Carolyn sinks her sword into the Shub-Niggurath for a final fatal time. It collapses to the ground, writhing slowly..."
"But after all the creatures she had defeated, she was prepared to battle for far longer than the beast could have imagined!"
"But the Shub-Niggurath continues to duck and dodge around her, moving like no physical being should be able to"
"Her experience is buying her lots of time as she continues to swing with her sword, hacking away bit by bit!"
The Shub-Niggurath senses this is not her first encounter with a being from Another World. This psychologist may be a worthy opponent!
It is a giant mass of tentacles with many faces full of gnashing teeth. Carolyn grips her sword knowing it is her only chance to survive!
The streets are in utter pandimonium. Creatures are everywhere. Bodies are strewn across the land. And an ancient being like nothing seen...
"She wakes to an empty hospital. She calls out, but only hears her own voice echo. She gets dressed and steps out into the streets..."
Finally she has a clear path. She arrives and is admitted. Carolyn takes a well earned rest. #ArkhamHorror
"Altho she is caught off guard, she still slays it with her trust magical sword. She really would like to be able to get to that Hospital now"
But a Mi-Go sweeps down from the sky! She cannot escape and must fight!
"She knows she can avoid most of them, but takes a swing at a Cultist and a Vampire since she's in the neighborhood. They both go down easily"
"Before she can make it the Hospital, she is interrupted by a swarm of creatures in the Misatonic University streets! #ArkhamHorror"
"On her way to the Hospital, she reads more of The King in Yellow. Suddenly it all makes sense! She realizes how imminent the danger truly is"
"The nearby Dock workers witness this, and Carolyn tells them of her adventure so far. They give her a few bucks and recommend the Hospital"
"A witch is sighted in the street. Sword in hand, Carolyn approaches. The witch lashes out but is no match for Carolyn and her sword!"
"A portal back home opens in the distance. She sprints thru it. It closes behind her, but there is no seal. This place still isn't safe..."
"She is knocked to the ground, but the creature is gone. She is hurt and shaken, but the battle seems to be over. #ArkhamHorror"
"The creatures finally clear, so Carolyn moves along. Out of nowhere a ghost like creatures appears in front of her, attacking with a sword!"
"There are monsters everywhere. This place is horrible! Carolyn hides, hoping they eventually move along."
"In pure shock, Carolyn is knocked to the ground. The beast dives at her but she holds out her sword, impaling it before it strikes."
"A snake-like beast slithers thru the air and attacks with his gaping mouth open, surrounded by outreached tentacles!"
"She is drawn into a shadowy Abyss where the full moon shines in distance, illuminating dark moving paths all around her."
"Eyes still watering, Carolyn investigates what her map describes only as ""Witch House"" only to find an open portal! She steps thru."
"She finds a chalkboard covered with insightful writings, but the dust sets off her allergies like crazy. Violent coughing fits ensues."
A nearby Science Building draws Carolyn's attention as a source of further knowledge. #ArkhamHorror
She waits until the sky clears once again. She sees police cars patroling in the distance. The gate finally closes behind her.
"She returns to Arkham, but the sky is a different color. The portal behind her remains open!"
"She does, however, find a stray page on the ground. It tells her exactly where the portal exit is and how to best seal it. Perfect!"
"In the Halls she sees a giant book open up before her. A extremely intimidating guard stands nearby, and she thinks better of approaching."
Entering the portal she is taken to a place known as the Great Hall of Celeano.
"Leaving the history records, still shaken by her findings, Carolyn spots another open portal in the distant woods. She investigates."
"She starts digging thru old records, only to find a folder with her own family name on it. It's contents are horrifying. Could this be true?"
Her map indicates a Historical Society across town. Perhaps this town has a documented history of strange occurrences. #ArkhamHorror
She swings her glorious mystic sword and the creature is slain!
She stumbles face first into giant formless snail-like creature of shifting shape. Its horrid and threatening!
"Now that she's finally home, she can read this Cabala of Saboth text that she can finally make sense of. Her reading distracts her however.."
"Carolyn sees an open portal back home and sprints towards it. She arrives back at the Graveyard, the portal closing and sealing behind her."
Alright. back to this game... #ArkhamHorror #Sidetracked
"Taking a moment to say that ""Reapers"" by @muse has the catchiest fucking guitar riffs ever. I keep playing it. God this songs rocks!"
Her brain is suddenly flooded with violent visions. A withering assault. She is confused and shaken... but feels a new power within her!
"Carolyn would love to take this opportunity to read something, but apparently she has to wait until she gets back home to do that! #RuleBook"
She steps thru the portal and is taken to a huge city in a desert. Her patient once described a City of the Great Race. This seems likely.
A graveyard in the distance has a glowing open portal to another world hovering at its front gate... It is like nothing she has ever seen.
"And suddenly, silence. The cave is empty. The air is silent. What the hell just happened? she asks herself, rattled. #ArkhamHorror"
"A cave is sighted in the distances... She approaches, and the winds pick up. She hears her name called. In the voice of her late mother..."
"She walks the streets and sees some cloth wrapped figures in the distance, milling around eerily... she quickens her step."
"As awesome as a bunch of books are, Carolyn is pretty stoked to have something that she could actually defend herself with. This town is F'd"
"Carolyn pulls out an ancient sword, glowing with magical powers! WHY WAS THIS HIDDEN UNDER A PORCH?! Sure as hell beats a lawnmower!"
She notices a gleam of light shining through a crack in porch steps... She reaches in... and grabs the handle of a sword!! #ArkhamHorror
"Frazzled by the theft, she wanders the neighborhoods until she spots an unnamed old abandoned house. #ArkhamHorror"
She is immediately spotted. They take all of her cash but ignore all her books. They are gone as quickly as they arrived. Nice town.
She then hears noises from the bank lobby. She peeks out to see three armed robbers! WTF of all goddamn times! #ArkhamHorror
Inside is an ancient book. The Necronomicon. Something she thought only existed in fantasy...
"She arrives at the bank and is brought to the vault. Her key opens a drawer, and a box is placed in front of her... https://t.co/PtTOSbQjDm"
"Among the other posessions she has from her former patient, a safety deposit box key. Time to visit the bank. #ArkhamHorror"
The dreams her patient would described during his sessions of hypnosis... She definitely came to the right town to find answers.
Screaming stops. A man in a straight jacket sits in the corner he begins to describe a vision in his head. It sounds just like the dreams.
She hears screaming from behind a cell door. No staff is in sight. She opens the door to investigate... #ArkhamHorror
She has an old copy of a play called The King in Yellow owned by her former patient. She begins reading it. Answers are yet to be found...
A storm rumbles overhead as Carolyn enters the Asylum.
"Armed with only potential, Carolyn Fern is brought to Arkham after a patient of hers is murdered. He once resided in the Arkham Asylum..."

But she no longer has any trophies to show for it. The hideous beast devours her before she can even raise the axe for one final battle.
She has fought long and hard thru the game. She has traveled thru many worlds and returned successfully each time...
"Kate appears back in Arkham. Standing before her is none other than The Yog-Sothoth itself, staring with its dozens of orb like eyes."

"Kate sees a portal back to Arkham in the distance... She heads towards it, eager to return home. Hoping there's still some of it left..."

She is transported to The Great Hall of Celeano. The sky is dark and the feeling is ominous.
"Seeing what may be one of her only opportunities, Kate runs thru the unguarded open portal! #ArkhamHorror"
The congregation proceeds to slaughter all of the beasts dwelling around the open portal at the Historical Society. It is a sight to be seen
"The church members are arming themselves when she arrives. ""We're taking back this neighborhood. And we have God on our side!"" One yells."
"And while she may be a woman of science, desperate times call for desperate measures. Kate heads to the church to be blessed."
She tells of her trips to other dimensions. He introduces himself as John Legrasse. His presence is strong willed and brave. Your new ally.
Monsters are spilling out of open portals left and right. Kate cannot do this alone. At the nearby Boarding House she finds a survivor.
"No solice is found. The ground shakes beneath Kate, knocking her off her feet. A bookshelf crashes around her. She is hurt, but will manage"
"There are creatures everywhere! Kate runs to the Silver Twilight Lodge once again, hoping to find safety with her new membership."
The cultist is slain and leaves behind an ancient book telling of Pharoahs and blood rituals to defeat ancient beings. Kate keeps the book.
"Suddenly, a Cultist appears before Kate. However, this was a familiar one... she had faced this exact one earlier! And it was alive again!"
"No dog, but an old man is found. He begins to tell you a story. It is extremely long and rambling. In the end, it is nothing but nonsense."
"Thoughts of that dog still haunt her. The woods continues to call her. And once again, Kate follows the call... #ArkhamHorror"
"Apparently this satisfied their needs, and she was granted membership. She always suspected these guys were kind of strange... #ArkhamHorror"
"In the city, she is chased by alien beasts, but escapes thru several alleys. She arrives back in the Silver Twilight Lodge, perplexed."
"She is greeted by Carl. He offers her membership, in exchange for a favor. Kate agrees, and a portal to the City of the Great Race opens!"
The Silver Twilight Lodge. It's always been a secretive place. Maybe some of it's members are still around. Hiding in their mansion.
She fights off another Cultist - do they ever STOP? - and catches her breath in the French Hill streets.
"The gate seals behind her and the Witch House is safe, but Kate can tell that Arkham has gotten worse since she left... is anybody left?"
"At the end of this hallway theres an open portal back home. Kate runs thru it, arriving across town from where she left. At the Witch House!"
It's an ancient Flesh Ward spell. Could come in handy against a strong creature if needed...
"Feeling confident in her detection of a pattern, Kate swipes the scroll while the eye is closed and darts down the nearest hallway!"
"The eye blinks, slowly. Remains shut for a moment, then slowly reopens. Kate freezes in place, watching the eye blink."
"The comes upon an alter with a scroll resting upon it. A gigantic eye peeks thru the wall behind it, staring directly at the scroll."
"She looks behind her to see a shadow of Earth... her hometown of Arkham... familiar. Safe. This comforts her, knowing she will return."
Kate is in a maze of mile-high living walls. She can see creatures slithering around in them. Faces looking out at her. Teeth gnashing.
Eerie piano music is heard in the background as she literally travels to Another Dimension.
"It beings to pour rain. There's no use in standing around. Kate spots an open portal at the Unvisited Isle, and heads into it. #ArkhamHorror"
She passes by the Unnamed old abandoned house once again. Her flux stabilizer starts humming. She knows she's safe.
She returns to the science lab. Speaks to an old colleague of the various monsters she's fought. The colleague shares what they've heard too
The city is nearly abandoned. Most have fled out of fear. Shops everywhere are boarded up.
"Extremely disappointed by her inability to catch a goddamn dog, she seeks solace in the place she is most familiar. The science building."
She tried. She tried so hard. She really did. But she is completely spent. The dog is gone. Stupid. Fucking. Dog.
"Against all odds, Kate sees the dog again! She races towards it and it immediately bolts in the other direction! STUPID FUCKING DOG!"
"Along the way she is startled by a zombie in the Uptown Streets. Her axe slays it, along with a nearby Cultist."
"Kate thinks of that dog from the woods. In the midst of all this chaos, the dog seems to worry her most. Maybe one more trip to the woods..."
"Once up close, Kate is much more fearful of this Ghoul. Her axe, however, is not. One more dead Ghoul."
"In the nearby Northside neighborhood, Kate spots another Ghoul. Northside is usually such a nice neighborhood. Time to make it safe again!"
The gate is sealed up behind her. Independence Square is now safe.
"In the distance Kate sees an open portal, returning to Arkham. She runs for towards it."
She is fine... but feeling confused. She realizes she can no longer remember one of her spells. It's gone from her mind completely...
The city is mostly abandoned. She see's the carcass of an alien creature but moves on. Suddenly a ripple through the air knocks her down.
Kate is teleported to an acient city. The City of the Great Race as it is mentioned in her research. Never thought she'd see it for herself.
"Just as she had suspected, a portal is open over Independence Square, only a few blocks away. It's time to close this down!"
the Historical Society is all the way across town. And her Flux Stabalizers is starting to give off signs of something closer...
"A man suddenly runs in, exhausted. ""Another one of those portal things just opened up over the Historical Society!"" They just keep coming..."
Its full of research papers. Dark supernatural stuff. Just like what she had been studying. Could prove useful. She pays him the money.
"She sits at a table. Joey ""the Rat"" Vigil quickly joins her. He slides her a file... $2 is what he asks for it. #ArkhamHorror"
"Kate decides to see what she can find out from the locals. Hibbs Roadhouse isn't always the safest joint, but she thinks it may have insight"
"Kate hears approaching sound. Sirens. Several cars and trucks with FBI painted on the side speed by. In the distance, gunshots are heard."
"Kate revisits the old abandoned house to seek more clues. She finds safety with the elder sign, but little else."
"Kate is scared, but still fights for her life, axe in hand. The creature is slain."
It scowls at Kate and begins to walk towards her.
"Leaving the general store, Kate sees a giant hairless brute shambling about the streets, flickering in and out of existence within Arkham"
"Among the goods, Kate sees what she needs most. Some freakin TNT. She buys the dynamite for $4."
"Her axe has treated her well so far, but Kate feels like she could still use more equipment. Time to visit the General Store. #ArkhamHorror"
"Right as she approaches the entrance of the cave, a Cultist appears from the darkness. It attacks and she strikes it down with her axe."
Off to explore the Black Cave. Maybe some more clues will be found over there. #ArkhamHorror
"Before leaving the old house, Kate sees an item in the fireplace... suddenly it ignites! She reaches for it but is burned. The item is gone."
He is brought down with a swift swing of the axe. Another slain maniac added to Kate Winthrop's trophy collection. #ArkhamHorror
"The cultist notices Kate, finally. The robed figure charges while Kate readies her axe."
Her flux stabilizer lights up and emits a deep mechanical hum. The wind lessens. The elder sign glows less brightly. The portal remains shut
Suddenly the ground around her rumbles. The elder sign glows brightly. The wind swirls around her as another portal tries to open!
Now to see what this cultist plans on doing when he discovers his pathway home closed up behind him... #ArkhamHorror
"The slumbering Yog Sothoth makes it more difficult, but the portal closes and seals shut with an Elder Sign symbol burnt in the ground."
A pathway back to the unnamable abandoned house appears before her. Kate returns to Arkham. A cultist is nearby. She works quietly...
"Kate sees a grate implanted into the side of a rock. She tries to pry it open, but it won't budge. She moves on."
"With a one-handed swing, Kate sinks her axe into the Ghoul. It is swiftly defeated. Timid but deadly Kate Winthrop hardly breaks a sweat."
"Out of nowhere a Ghoul appears! There is no escaping, Kate must fight for her life!"
She read of this place in her studies. The Plateau of Leng. A dense and dark forest full of savagery and terrifying creatures. #ArkhamHorror
"an open portal to another dimension is on the old abandoned house, with no creatures in sight. We must try to close this. Kate steps thru..."
"Upon returning, the people of the Merch Dist are in the streets, armed, telling stories of how they took fought off the alien beings."
There's nothing else in the woods. Time to investigate the sounds from the Merchant District. #ArkhamHorror
"There's a lost dog! Kate tries to catch him but he is too quick. Poor little guy, all alone out in the woods... #ArkhamHorror"
Kate hears all sorts of terriying sounds coming from the merchant district. She books it for the woods.
"Before departing the Science Building, Kate finds a student working on a mysterious device. Now is not the time, but it may prove useful..."
"Armed with an affinity towards magic, a flask of holy water, and a fire axe, Kate Winthrop begins her quest to save Arkham..."
"In addition to her Flux Stabalizer, Kate has spent years delving into the dark mysterious corners of scientific studies. This = spells."
The ever growing evil presence of the lurking Yog-Sothoth is undeniable... #ArkhamHorror
"Having witnessed with her own eyes the evil lurking just under the surface of Arkham, she has developed a device - the Flux Stabalizer."
Our investigator is Kate Winthrop. The shy but brilliant researcher from the Miskatonic Science Labs. #ArkhamHorror #soloboardgaming
It should be noted that I am also playing with the King in Yellow and Curse of the Dark Pharoah expansions shuffled into everything.

@alangephart The full live-Tweet of my crazy-lucky Arkham Horror game as Bob Jenkins for those who missed it. https://t.co/8O0oieIaTi
No live tweet this time around. Last one was great. Not gonna press my luck.
I may or may not be playing one more solo #ArkhamHorror game before the day is done. This is how I spend my days off.
@reignyday206 no kidding! We seriously lucked out with that first general store draw!
"Only to be slain by Bon Jenkins, traveling salesman. #GoBobGo! #OurHeroBobJenkins #ArkhamHorror"
"The Ithaqua was slain. Awoken from its ancient slumber, destined to reign terror on the town of Arkham, then the world. #ArkhamHorror"
Our hero. Barely holding it together. https://t.co/Q5Wuu62NyX
The final blow! #ArkhamHorror https://t.co/ETXQefzMar
But Bob's shotgun prevailed. The most important impulse buy of his life.
The Ithaqua was fast and deadly. Bob was down to his last ounce of strength and sanity. A single hit would end it decisively.
"The battle is rapid, Bob unloads his shotgun again and again while the beast charges, knocking him thru the air."
"With nothing but his trusty shotgun and the small mystic blade, Bob battles the Ithaqua. It has awoken. #ArkhamHorror"
"The world around him becomes a blur as this monstrosity faces him, leaving him no chance to flee. He can only fight. And pray."
The temperature drops significantly as a creature like none he has seen so far appears before him.
"Bob arrives at the science building, only to feel the ground beneath him begin to shakes. A roar built up around him."
One nurse tells Bob of the science building nearby. Perhaps they could give him further insight as to what's happening. #ArkhamHorror
The battle is bloody and horrid. Both beasts lie dead before Bob and his smoking shogun. It's time to visit the hospital again.
"One is a winged, tentacled beast with 7 eyes. The other is a worm with about a million teeth. This shit sucks! #GoodLuckBob"
"Just as Bob gets in his good head space, in the middle of the street there are two giant hideous beasts."
"On his way out, Bob notices some inspirational writing on a tombstone. It levels his head and he's feeling calm and sane once again."
"The flash is blinding. Bob wakes on the ground, unclear as to how much time has passed. Graveyard. Great idea. #ArkhamHorror"
Some weird local theater group is holding rehearsal. In the graveyard. They notice Bob and vanish in a flash of yellow light. #ArkhamHorror
Bob decides to do what anybody in a town of increasing deadly other-dimensional presence would do. Check out the local graveyard!
The hospital treats his wounds and Bob feels as good as new! #ArkhamHorror
Even gives him a few bucks to cover the treatment. Bob graciously accepts and heads in the direction of the hospital.
"The dock worker hardly flinches at the story, but rather seems to understand completely. He directs Bob to the hospital across town."
"At a nearby dock, a local comments on Bob's haggard and bloodied appearance. Bob tells his tale of travel and battle. #ArkhamHorror"
@reignyday206 better than snake oil at least. Whatever pays the bills/buys the gold/guns.
"Bob swings the ancient sword he assumed was for decorative purposes only until now. In a burst of bright magical light, the gatorslug dies"
"It's time to get serious. Bob has a few oddball antiques on him, and one of them might just do the trick... #ArkhamHorror"
"And just as Bob thought things had settled for a moment, this fucking alligator slug thing pops out of thin air! https://t.co/8EQJWHbQ3J"
"He saw this sign in the manuscript from this house. An elder sign, it was called. #ArkhamHorror"
@reignyday206 fact: never pick a fight with a traveling salesman. They know how to throw down 110% of the time:
"Returning to town, standing once again in front of the old house, the portal behind him closes. A star-like symbol is burned into the ground"
Bob sees a familiar light in the distance. Another bright orb. This time with visions of the house that once stood in Arkham! He runs to it!
"On the limp body of the villager, Bob finds a small blade with ancient engravings. Looks mystic. Definitely a keeper. #ArkhamHorror"
"Not having time to reach his weapons, they struggle in hand to hand combat until Bob wrestles him down in a choke hold."
"Rather than safety, Bob finds himself facing the largest and fiercest looking of all the barbaric natives in this God forsaken dimension."
The screams of the man tied to the poll fade in the distance as Bob runs to what he hopes will be safety. #ArkhamHorror
"The natives quickly notice his presence and turn their spears on him. He is chased back into the forest, bleeding from his fresh wounds."
"He comes upon an opening. To his horror he sees a man surrounded by natives, bound to a poll as the fire at his feet begins to grow."
"He is in a deep dark forest like none he has ever seen in all of his travels. Not sure what to do, Bob chooses a direction, and walks."
"Unable to withhold his amazement and curiosity, Bob steps into the light. He is instantly transported. #ArkhamHorror"
"In the place of the house, there is a giant orb of light. Bob peers into it and visions of a dark and surreal forest can be seen far off..."
"In the distance, where the creepy old manuscript house was, there are mysterious lights. Bob investigates... #ArkhamHorror"
It suddenly dawns on Bob. He checks for his wallet in his coat pocket. It's gone. He runs to the streets after the man but he has vanished.
"A man quickly rushes past him in a hurry, stumbling into him as he passes, apologizing, and darting out the door... Weird... #ArkhamHorror"
"Seeking out people to tell of this manuscript, Bob finds a roadhouse nearby. Right off the bat he senses unease from its occupants."
"But it does mention an ancient Arctic being, portals to other dimensions, and devout cultists... And Bob can take a hint. #ArkhamHorror"
"An old manuscript is found. It is long, and ultimately gives no hard answers in its long winded babbling. #ArkhamHorror"
"Bob wanders the eerie streets until coming upon a large, abandoned house. He feels he will find more answers within and investigates..."
The Silver Twilight Lodge is empty. Wtf. #ArkhamHorror
He runs to the nearby lodge to tell somebody about the sudden attack he survived. #ArkhamHorror
Bob figures out that there is definitely a bigger story behind those strange gold coins. Something bizarre is happening in this town.
"He promptly raises his shotgun and pulls the trigger. The crazed Cultist is blown away in a deadly, bloody blast. #ArkhamHorror"
Bob is caught off guard by the sudden hostility and is struck to the ground.
"Upon approaching, the hooded man yells ""Hail the Ithaqua!"" And charges forward, staff raised to strike! #ArkhamHorror"
"Bob takes to the streets again, only to stumble upon a cloaked figure roaming French Hill #ArkhamHorror"
"Meanwhile, in the distance, evil continues to stir in its slumber... #ArkhamHorror"
Bob wanders to the nearby black cave and finds himself lost in meditative thought. An image of dark magical power fills his mind.
@reignyday206 old cold coins and guns. The two things Bob can't say no to.
"Before departing the general store, Bob buys that shotgun he's had his eye on. This would inevitably be a great idea. #ArkhamHorror."
"The weather is cold and icy, the wind blows hard. The streets are no place to be caught in these brutal conditions. #ArkhamHorror"
"Bob Jenkins, traveling salesman whose attention was caught by some gold coins. He'll investigate further... He likes gold... #ArkhamHorror"
Ready for more #ArkhamHorror! #soloboardgaming #NotEvenEmbarassed
"And then Sister Mary was promptly devoured. After all, she was just a sweet little nun. In WAY over her head. RIP Sister Mary."
"As the Yig woke from its ancient slumber, she doused it in holy water, scalding its flesh as it cried out in pain!"
She was an open minded nun who asked all the right questions and harnessed the power of magic despite her religious convictions.
Had a warmup game of Arkham Horror that lasted very late into the night. Sister Mary put up a good fight.
